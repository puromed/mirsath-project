# Progress Summary

## Previous State
- A basic registration and login flow for members was in place, requiring admin approval.
- However, there was no way for an admin to log in to approve new members.

## Admin Authentication System (Completed)

### Problem Encountered
- The application had a separate `staff_accounts` table but no functional login system for staff/admins.
- This involved a series of cascading errors, including missing files, incorrect route definitions, mismatched component logic, and misconfigured middleware.

### Actions Taken

1.  **Configured Dual Authentication:**
    - Verified the `config/auth.php` file was correctly set up with two guards: `web` for members and `staff` for administrators.
    - This allows two separate user types to log in via different mechanisms.

2.  **Implemented Staff Models:**
    - Corrected the `StaffAccount` model to make it compatible with Laravel's authentication system (`extends Authenticatable`).
    - Ensured the `StaffSeeder` correctly and safely populates the `staff` and `staff_accounts` tables using `updateOrCreate` to prevent errors on re-seeding.

3.  **Created Staff Authentication Logic:**
    - Created the `StaffLoginController` to handle showing the login form and processing the login attempt using the `staff` guard.
    - Created the `StaffLoginRequest` form request to validate the admin's credentials (`email`, `password`) against the `staff_accounts` table.

4.  **Established Admin Routes:**
    - Added a dedicated, prefixed route group (`/admin/...`) in `routes/web.php` for all staff and admin functionality.
    - Created routes for the admin login page (`/admin/login`) and the logout action (`/admin/logout`).

5.  **Corrected Middleware:**
    - Updated the `RedirectIfAuthenticated` middleware to handle the `staff` guard, redirecting logged-in admins to the `admin.dashboard` if they try to visit the login page.
    - Updated the `Authenticate` middleware to redirect unauthenticated users trying to access admin pages to the correct `admin.login` route instead of the member login page.

6.  **Fixed Frontend Components:**
    - Rebuilt the `AdminLogin.jsx` page to match the structure and components of the working `Login.jsx`, resolving a critical rendering error.
    - Corrected the form to submit to the correct URL (`/admin/login`).
    - Implemented a functional logout button in the `AppLayout.jsx` sidebar, allowing admins to log out.

## Current Workflow

### Member Flow (Unchanged)
1.  User registers at `/register`.
2.  Member status is set to "Pending".
3.  User is redirected to `/login`.

### Admin Flow (New)
1.  Admin navigates to `/admin/login`.
2.  Enters credentials stored in the `staff_accounts` table.
3.  On success, is redirected to `/admin/dashboard`.
4.  Can log out using the sidebar link.

## Summary
The application now has a robust, fully functional, and separate authentication system for administrators. This unblocks the next critical step: building the UI for admins to approve or reject pending member registrations.

## Recent Progress (July 16, 2025)

### User Dashboard Payment Flow Fixed

-   **Corrected Payment Data Fetching:**
    -   Modified the `UserDashboardController` to use the correct Eloquent relationship (`transactions` instead of `payments`) to fetch payment records.
    -   Fixed the query to sort payments by `transaction_date` to ensure chronological order.
    -   Added Carbon date formatting on the backend for all dates sent to the frontend, ensuring a consistent and clean display.

-   **Implemented Conditional Annual Fee Card:**
    -   The controller now sends a `hasPaidAnnual` boolean prop to the frontend.
    -   The `UserDashboard.jsx` component uses this prop to conditionally display either a payment prompt or a "Thank You" message, providing clear feedback to the user.

-   **Resolved Frontend Rendering Errors:**
    -   Conducted a major refactor of `UserDashboard.jsx` to eliminate duplicated code blocks, fix all mismatched JSX tags, and resolve persistent syntax errors that were preventing the page from rendering correctly.

## Recent Progress (July 15, 2025)

### Member Login Flow Fixed
- Cleaned `AuthenticatedSessionController` and `LoginRequest` to ensure members authenticate via the `web` guard.
- Added DB flag `has_seen_status_update` to show one-time approval / rejection modal.
- Registration flow no longer auto-logs users in; they must wait for admin approval.
- Sidebar logout now works for both admin and members.

### Dynamic Member Dashboard (MVP)
- Created `UserDashboardController` to supply real data (member, dependents, claims, payments) to Inertia.
- Replaced static mocks in `UserDashboard.jsx` with live props from the server while preserving Radix UI design.
- Added dynamic `/dashboard` route wired to the new controller.

### Safety Guards
- Controller only eager-loads relations that actually exist to prevent "undefined relationship" errors.

### Admin Approval UI Completed
- Admin dashboard now lists pending members and allows Approve / Reject actions.
- Status updates reset `has_seen_status_update` so the member sees a one-time modal on next login.

## Next Steps

### 1. Dependent Management (Add / Edit / Delete)
- Build a modal form on the member dashboard to add a new dependent (name, NRIC, relationship, date of birth).
- Create REST endpoints (store, update, destroy) in `DependentController` guarded by auth.
- Update dashboard to list dependents dynamically and allow edits/removals.
